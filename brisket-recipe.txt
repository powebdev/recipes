1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Place brisket, fat side up, on top of the onions and mushrooms.
Sprinkle garlic on top and add salt and ground pepper.
In a small bowl add the tomato paste, vinegars, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar, whisk to combine.
Using a spoon, spread the tomato paste mixture on the top of the beef.

Remove brisket from the slow cooker place on serving plate.
Using a slotted spoon, remove the onions and mushrooms and place on top of the beef.
Cover tightly with foil to retain the heat.
Turn crock pot temperature to high.
